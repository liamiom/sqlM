# Function scripts 

Function scripts are designed to handle the creation and update of database functions. Function scripts will automatically be included in the database update. Generally, functions are not called from the application layer, so a method is not generated by default.
A function script can be added with the Cli like so.
``` CMD
sqlM Add Function
```
